# Android Weather App with Flutter

With the help of this source code, you can develop an Android weather app using Flutter. This app assists the user in obtaining weather information for various cities from the  [OpenWeatherMap.Org](https://openweathermap.org/api) website.

Initially, the app displays information for four cities: London, Dubai, New York, and Tehran. Users can remove a city from their list by sliding or dragging the city's icon. Additionally, users can search for and add a city to their list, viewing it on the main page by adding it to the home screen of the app.

This software is developed using the Dart programming language with the bloc architecture. Hive is utilized for storing information in the device's internal memory.
